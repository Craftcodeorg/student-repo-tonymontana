# Lecture 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Understand the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing in data analysis.
- Identify common data issues and how to handle them using Pandas.
- Apply basic data cleaning techniques to prepare datasets for analysis, specifically in the context of stock trading.

### 2. Introduction:
Data cleaning and preprocessing are crucial steps in any data analysis process, especially in fields like stock trading where decisions are made based on data insights. Inaccurate or messy data can lead to incorrect analyses and poor investment decisions. As an aspiring Python Developer focusing on stock trading, mastering these techniques will empower you to handle financial datasets effectively, ensuring that your analyses are based on clean, reliable data. This lecture will provide you with foundational skills that are essential for your career goals in finance.

### 3. Core Concepts:
#### A. Importance of Data Cleaning
- **Definition**: Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in data to improve its quality.
- **Impact**: Clean data enhances the reliability of your analyses, leading to better decision-making in stock trading.

#### B. Common Data Issues
- **Missing Values**: Often found in datasets, missing values can skew results. Techniques to handle them include:
  - **Removing Rows**: If the missing data is minimal.
  - **Imputation**: Filling missing values with mean, median, or mode.

- **Duplicate Data**: Duplicates can arise from multiple data sources. Use the `drop_duplicates()` function to remove them.

- **Incorrect Data Types**: Financial data often requires specific formats (e.g., dates). Use `pd.to_datetime()` to convert strings to datetime objects.

#### C. Basic Data Cleaning Techniques
- **Renaming Columns**: Use `df.rename()` for clarity.
- **Filtering Data**: Use conditions to filter out unnecessary information (e.g., stocks below a certain price).
- **Handling Outliers**: Identify outliers using visualization tools like box plots and decide whether to remove or adjust them.

### 4. Practical Application:
In stock trading, clean datasets are vital for accurate analysis. For instance, consider a dataset containing daily stock prices. Hereâ€™s a simple code snippet demonstrating how to handle missing values:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Fill missing values with the mean price
df['Close'] = df['Close'].fillna(df['Close'].mean())

# Remove duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Convert date column to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
```

This snippet shows how to ensure your dataset is ready for analysis by addressing missing values and formatting issues.

### 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we explored the significance of data cleaning and preprocessing in preparing datasets for analysis, particularly in stock trading. Key takeaways include the identification of common data issues such as missing values and duplicates, as well as basic techniques to clean your data using Pandas. Mastering these skills will enhance your ability to analyze financial datasets accurately.

### 6. Next Steps:
In the next lecture, we will delve into exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas, where you will learn how to visualize and interpret your cleaned data. To prepare, review the concepts of basic statistics and familiarize yourself with different types of visualizations, as they will be essential for understanding EDA techniques.
