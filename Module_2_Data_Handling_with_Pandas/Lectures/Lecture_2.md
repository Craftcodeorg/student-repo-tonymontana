# Lecture: 2. Loading Datasets from CSV Files

### 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Understand the significance of CSV files in data handling.
- Load CSV datasets into Pandas DataFrames effectively.
- Perform basic data inspection to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Introduction:
In the world of data analysis, particularly in stock trading, the ability to handle and manipulate data is crucial. CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are one of the most common formats for storing tabular data, including stock prices, trading volumes, and financial metrics. This lecture will introduce you to loading datasets from CSV files using Pandas, a powerful library in Python that simplifies data manipulation. Mastering this skill is essential for any aspiring Python Developer in the finance sector, as it lays the foundation for analyzing and making informed decisions based on stock market data.

### 3. Core Concepts:
#### A. Understanding CSV Files
- **Definition**: CSV files are plain text files that use commas to separate values. Each line in a CSV file represents a row of data.
- **Importance**: They are widely used for data exchange between different applications, especially in finance where datasets can be downloaded from various sources.

#### B. Loading CSV Files with Pandas
- **Using `pd.read_csv()`**: This function is the primary way to load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
  - **Syntax**: `pd.read_csv('file_path.csv')`
  - **Parameters**: Key parameters include `delimiter`, `header`, and `index_col`.

#### C. Inspecting Loaded Data
- **Basic Inspection Methods**:
  - `.head()`: Displays the first five rows of the DataFrame.
  - `.info()`: Provides a summary of the DataFrame including data types and non-null counts.
  - `.describe()`: Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns.

### 4. Practical Application:
Imagine you have downloaded historical stock price data for NVIDIA in a CSV format. Hereâ€™s how you would load and inspect that dataset using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
nvidia_stock_data = pd.read_csv('nvidia_stock_prices.csv')

# Inspect the first few rows
print(nvidia_stock_data.head())

# Get a summary of the dataset
print(nvidia_stock_data.info())
```

In this example, you can see how easy it is to load your stock data into a DataFrame and begin your analysis.

### 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we explored how to load datasets from CSV files using Pandas. We learned about the structure of CSV files, how to use the `pd.read_csv()` function, and basic methods to inspect our data. Remember, being proficient in loading and understanding your datasets is a crucial step towards analyzing stock market trends and making informed trading decisions.

### 6. Next Steps:
In our next lecture, we will delve into data cleaning techniques using Pandas, which will help you prepare your datasets for analysis. To prepare, consider reviewing any CSV files you have on stock data and think about what insights you might want to extract from them. This will set a strong foundation for our upcoming discussions on data manipulation techniques!
