# Module Title: Data Handling with Pandas

## Example 2: Cleaning Missing Data in a DataFrame

### 1. Introduction
In finance, data integrity is paramount. Missing data can lead to inaccurate analyses and misguided trading decisions. This example focuses on cleaning missing data in a DataFrame, a crucial step that builds upon the foundational skills learned in the previous lecture about loading datasets from CSV files. By effectively handling missing values, you can ensure your analyses are based on complete and reliable datasets, which is essential for making informed decisions in stock trading.

### 2. Code Snippet
Here’s a well-commented code snippet that demonstrates how to clean missing data in a Pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
nvidia_stock_data = pd.read_csv('nvidia_stock_prices.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print("Initial Data:")
print(nvidia_stock_data.head())

# Check for missing values
print("\nMissing Values Count:")
print(nvidia_stock_data.isnull().sum())

# Fill missing values with the mean of the column (for numerical columns)
nvidia_stock_data.fillna(nvidia_stock_data.mean(), inplace=True)

# Alternatively, drop rows with missing values
# nvidia_stock_data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Verify that there are no more missing values
print("\nMissing Values Count After Cleaning:")
print(nvidia_stock_data.isnull().sum())

# Display the cleaned dataset
print("\nCleaned Data:")
print(nvidia_stock_data.head())
```

### 3. Explanation
- **Importing Pandas**: The code starts by importing the Pandas library, which is essential for data manipulation.
- **Loading the Dataset**: It loads the NVIDIA stock prices dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.
- **Initial Data Display**: The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to give an overview of the data structure.
- **Checking for Missing Values**: The code checks for missing values using `isnull().sum()`, which returns the count of missing entries for each column.
- **Filling Missing Values**: The `fillna()` function is used to replace any missing values with the mean of their respective columns. This is a common technique in finance to maintain data integrity without losing rows.
- **Dropping Rows with Missing Values**: An alternative method is commented out, which shows how to drop rows with any missing values using `dropna()`. This can be useful if the dataset is large enough that losing some rows won’t significantly impact the analysis.
- **Final Verification**: After cleaning, it checks again for missing values to ensure all have been handled.
- **Displaying Cleaned Data**: Finally, it displays the cleaned dataset.

### 4. Application
In real-world finance, analysts often work with historical stock price data that may contain gaps due to various reasons, such as market closures or errors in data collection. For instance, if you are analyzing NVIDIA's stock performance over time and encounter missing entries, failing to address these gaps could skew your analysis of trends or volatility.

By cleaning the data effectively, you ensure that your analysis reflects accurate stock performance, allowing you to make informed trading decisions based on complete information. This process not only improves the quality of your insights but also enhances the reliability of any predictive models you may develop later on.
