# Module Title: Data Handling with Pandas

## Example 3: Calculating Descriptive Statistics

### 1. Introduction
In this section, we will explore the significance of calculating descriptive statistics, particularly in the context of finance and stock trading. Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a dataset's distribution, which is crucial for making informed decisions in financial markets. This builds upon the key concepts from Lecture 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, where we learned about the importance of preparing our data for analysis. By applying descriptive statistics, we can gain insights into stock performance and volatility, allowing us to make better investment choices.

### 2. Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a well-commented code snippet that demonstrates how to calculate descriptive statistics using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the stock prices dataset
df = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')

# Check for missing values before proceeding
if df.isnull().sum().any():
    print("Warning: Missing values detected. Filling missing values with mean.")
    df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)

# Calculate descriptive statistics
descriptive_stats = df.describe()

# Display the descriptive statistics
print("Descriptive Statistics:")
print(descriptive_stats)

# Save the descriptive statistics to a CSV file for further analysis
descriptive_stats.to_csv('descriptive_statistics.csv')
```

### 3. Explanation
Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Importing Libraries**: We start by importing the `pandas` library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: The stock prices dataset is loaded into a DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`. This function reads a CSV file and converts it into a DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional data structure similar to a table.

3. **Checking for Missing Values**: Before calculating descriptive statistics, we check for any missing values in the dataset using `df.isnull().sum().any()`. If missing values are found, we print a warning message and fill these missing values with the mean of their respective columns using `df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)`. This step ensures that our calculations are not skewed by incomplete data.

4. **Calculating Descriptive Statistics**: We use `df.describe()` to compute a summary of descriptive statistics for all numerical columns in the DataFrame. This includes metrics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.

5. **Displaying Results**: The calculated descriptive statistics are printed to the console for review.

6. **Saving Results**: Finally, we save the descriptive statistics to a new CSV file called 'descriptive_statistics.csv' for further analysis or reporting purposes.

### 4. Application
In the finance sector, calculating descriptive statistics is vital for assessing the performance of stocks. For instance, investors can use these statistics to evaluate the average closing price of a stock over a specific period, identify volatility through standard deviation, and understand price distribution through quartiles. By analyzing these metrics, traders can make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks based on their risk tolerance and investment strategies.

Descriptive statistics also help in identifying trends and anomalies within stock price movements. For example, if a stock shows a significantly higher mean than its peers but also has high volatility (standard deviation), it may indicate potential risks or opportunities that require deeper analysis.
