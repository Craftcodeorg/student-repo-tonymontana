### Module Title: Data Handling with Pandas ###

---

### Exercise Requirements ###

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   You are an aspiring Python Developer looking to analyze stock trading data. You have been provided with a CSV file named `stock_prices.csv` that contains historical stock prices for various companies. Your task is to load this data using Pandas and display the first five rows. This will help you understand the structure of the dataset and identify key columns for your analysis, such as 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close' prices.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**: 
   Below is the starter code to help you get started with loading and displaying the stock prices data. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Starter code for loading stock price data
   def load_stock_data(file_name):
       # Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
       data = pd.read_csv('__________')  # Fill in the blank with the file name
       
       # Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
       print(data.__________())  # Fill in the blank with the appropriate method to display the first five rows

   # Call the function with the correct file name
   load_stock_data('__________')  # Fill in the blank with the file name
   ```

3. **Hints**: 
   - For loading data from a CSV file, remember to use `pd.read_csv()`. The argument should be the name of your CSV file.
   - To display the first five rows of a DataFrame, you can use a method that starts with "head". 
   - Make sure to pass the correct file name when calling your function.

4. **Expected Outcome**: 
   After filling in the blanks correctly, running your code should display the first five rows of the stock prices dataset. This will demonstrate your understanding of how to load and inspect data using Pandas, which is essential for your goal of analyzing stock market data.

   The final solution should look something like this:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Starter code for loading stock price data
   def load_stock_data(file_name):
       # Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
       data = pd.read_csv(file_name)  # Fill in the blank with the file name
       
       # Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
       print(data.head())  # Fill in the blank with the appropriate method to display the first five rows

   # Call the function with the correct file name
   load_stock_data('stock_prices.csv')  # Fill in the blank with the file name
   ```
