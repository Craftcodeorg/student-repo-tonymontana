### Module Title: Introduction to Quantitative Analysis ###

### Exercise Requirements ###

#### 1. Problem Statement:
Imagine you are a budding Python Developer focusing on stock trading, and you have made an investment in a stock. You initially invested $500 in a company, and after a year, the value of your investment has grown to $750. Your task is to develop a script that computes the Return on Investment (ROI) based on your initial investment and the final value of your investment. This exercise will help you apply the concepts of mean, median, variance, and standard deviation discussed in the lecture to real-world financial scenarios.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
Below is the starter code for calculating ROI. Fill in the blanks where indicated to complete the functionality.

```python
# Starter code for calculating Return on Investment (ROI)
def calculate_roi(initial_investment, final_value):
    # Calculate ROI using the formula: (Final Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment
    roi = (_______ - _______) / _______
    return roi

# Test the function with example values
initial_investment = 500  # Your initial investment amount
final_value = 750         # The value of your investment after a year

# Print the ROI
print(f"Return on Investment (ROI): {calculate_roi(_____, _____)}")
```

#### 3. Hints:
- Recall that ROI is calculated as the difference between the final value and the initial investment, divided by the initial investment.
- Make sure to replace the blanks with the appropriate variables defined earlier in your code.
- Think about how you can express your final ROI as a percentage by multiplying it by 100 after calculating it.
- Remember to include error handling in your code to manage cases where the initial investment might be zero to avoid division by zero errors.

#### 4. Expected Outcome:
By filling in the blanks correctly, you will demonstrate an understanding of how to compute ROI using Python. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling for potential issues like division by zero, and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step. Your output should clearly display the ROI percentage based on your investment scenario.

### Integration ###
- Ensure that all sections are clearly structured with headings for easy navigation.
- Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links if applicable.
- This exercise will reinforce your understanding of quantitative analysis concepts while aligning with your goal of becoming a Python Developer in finance.
