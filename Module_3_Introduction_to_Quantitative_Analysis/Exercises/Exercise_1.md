### Module Title: Introduction to Quantitative Analysis

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   As a budding Python Developer focused on stock trading, you are tasked with analyzing the stock returns of NVIDIA over the past week. Your goal is to assess the risk associated with these returns by calculating the variance. Variance is a critical measure in finance that helps traders understand how much the returns deviate from the expected return, which can inform risk management strategies.

   Using the following daily returns for NVIDIA's stock:
   - Monday: 1.5%
   - Tuesday: 2.0%
   - Wednesday: -0.5%
   - Thursday: 3.0%
   - Friday: 1.0%

   Write a function to calculate the variance of these stock returns. 

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
   Below is the starter code where you need to fill in the blanks to complete the functionality for calculating the variance of stock returns.

   ```python
   # Starter code for implementing variance calculation based on lecture concepts
   def calculate_variance(returns):
       # Calculate the mean of the returns
       mean_return = sum(returns) / len(returns)
       
       # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of squared differences
       squared_diffs = 0
       
       # Loop through each return to calculate squared differences
       for return_value in returns:
           squared_diffs += (return_value - mean_return) ** 2
       
       # Calculate variance by dividing the total squared differences by the number of returns
       variance = squared_diffs / len(returns)  # Fill in this blank
       
       return variance
   
   # Test the function with NVIDIA's daily returns
   nvidia_returns = [1.5, 2.0, -0.5, 3.0, 1.0]  # Fill in this blank
   print(f"The variance of NVIDIA's stock returns is: {calculate_variance(nvidia_returns):.4f}")
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - Recall that variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and thus from every other number in the set.
   - Ensure that you are summing up the squared differences correctly; consider using a loop to iterate through each return.
   - Remember that variance is typically calculated as the average of these squared differences.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   By completing this exercise, you should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how to calculate variance using Python. Your final solution should:
   - Accurately compute the variance based on NVIDIA's stock returns.
   - Include comments explaining each step of your code.
   - Handle any potential errors gracefully (e.g., if the input list is empty).

### Integration
- Ensure this exercise is structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into your learning platform.
- Use markdown for formatting, and if necessary, provide additional resources or links for further reading on variance and its significance in finance.
