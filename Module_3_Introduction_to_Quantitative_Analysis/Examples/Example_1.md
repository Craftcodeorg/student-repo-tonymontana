# Module Title: Introduction to Quantitative Analysis

## Required Example Details

### 1. Introduction
In this section, we will explore "Example 1: Calculating mean and standard deviation of stock returns," which is a fundamental concept covered in the lecture titled **# Lecture 1: Basics of Quantitative Analysis in Finance**. Understanding how to calculate the mean and standard deviation of stock returns is crucial for evaluating the performance of stocks and making informed trading decisions. This example builds upon the key concepts discussed in the lecture, such as descriptive statistics and their importance in finance.

### 2. Code Snippet
Below is a well-commented Python code snippet that illustrates how to calculate the mean and standard deviation of stock returns using the pandas library. This code is suitable for a beginner-level programmer and includes error handling and best practices.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data: Stock prices for NVIDIA over a week
data = {
    'Day': ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday'],
    'Price': [150, 155, 152, 158, 160]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate daily returns as percentage change
df['Return'] = df['Price'].pct_change() * 100

# Handle potential NaN values in the 'Return' column
df['Return'].fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Replace NaN with 0 for the first day

# Calculate mean and standard deviation of returns
mean_return = df['Return'].mean()
std_dev_return = df['Return'].std()

# Print the results
print(f"The average daily return for NVIDIA this week is: {mean_return:.2f}%")
print(f"The standard deviation of daily returns is: {std_dev_return:.2f}%")
```

### 3. Explanation
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The `pandas` library is imported to handle data manipulation.
  
2. **Creating Sample Data**: A dictionary containing days of the week and corresponding stock prices for NVIDIA is defined.

3. **Creating a DataFrame**: The dictionary is converted into a pandas DataFrame, which allows for easy data manipulation.

4. **Calculating Daily Returns**: The daily returns are calculated using the `pct_change()` method, which computes the percentage change between the current and previous prices. This represents the return on investment for each day.

5. **Handling NaN Values**: The first day's return will be NaN (not a number) since there is no previous price to compare it with. We replace this NaN value with 0 using `fillna()`.

6. **Calculating Mean and Standard Deviation**: The mean and standard deviation of the daily returns are calculated using `mean()` and `std()` methods, respectively. The mean indicates the average return, while the standard deviation measures the volatility or risk associated with those returns.

7. **Printing Results**: Finally, the results are printed to the console, providing insights into NVIDIA's stock performance over the week.

### 4. Application
In finance, calculating the mean and standard deviation of stock returns is vital for assessing investment performance. Investors use these metrics to understand how much return they can expect on average and how much risk (volatility) is associated with that investment.

For example, if an investor is considering purchasing NVIDIA stock, they can use these calculations to compare its historical performance against other stocks or indices. A higher mean return might indicate better performance, while a higher standard deviation could signal greater risk. This analysis helps investors make informed decisions about whether to buy, hold, or sell their investments.
