# Module Title: Introduction to Quantitative Analysis

## Example 5: Creating a Financial Model for Investment Analysis

### 1. Introduction
Creating a financial model for investment analysis is a vital skill in finance, especially for stock traders. This example draws from the concepts discussed in Lecture 5: Risk Assessment and Management Strategies. Understanding risk assessment and management allows traders to make informed decisions that can lead to better investment outcomes. By developing a financial model, you will apply the principles of risk management, such as diversification and Value at Risk (VaR), to real-world scenarios, enhancing your skills as a Python Developer focused on stock trading.

### 2. Code Snippet
Below is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to create a simple financial model for analyzing the potential risk of an investment portfolio. This code uses `pandas` and `numpy` to simulate daily returns and calculate the Value at Risk (VaR).

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Function to calculate Value at Risk (VaR)
def calculate_var(returns, confidence_level=0.95):
    """
    Calculate the Value at Risk (VaR) for a given set of returns.
    
    Parameters:
    returns (array-like): Array of daily returns.
    confidence_level (float): The confidence level for VaR calculation (default is 0.95).
    
    Returns:
    float: The calculated VaR at the specified confidence level.
    """
    if not isinstance(returns, (pd.Series, np.ndarray)):
        raise ValueError("Returns must be a pandas Series or numpy array.")
    
    # Calculate the VaR at the specified confidence level
    var = np.percentile(returns, (1 - confidence_level) * 100)
    return var

# Sample daily returns for a portfolio
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
returns = np.random.normal(0, 0.01, 1000)  # Simulated daily returns

# Calculate VaR at 95% confidence level
try:
    VaR_95 = calculate_var(returns)
    print(f"Value at Risk (95%): {VaR_95:.2%}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### 3. Explanation
- **Imports**: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, `pandas` and `numpy`, which are essential for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Function Definition**: The `calculate_var` function takes an array of returns and a confidence level (default is set to 95%). It checks if the input is valid and calculates the VaR using the `np.percentile` function.
- **Simulated Returns**: The code generates a sample of daily returns using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.01.
- **VaR Calculation**: The function is called to compute the VaR, and the result is printed in percentage format. Error handling is included to manage invalid inputs.

This code snippet exemplifies how to apply risk assessment techniques learned in the lecture, specifically focusing on VaR, which helps investors understand potential losses in extreme market conditions.

### 4. Application
In practice, financial analysts and stock traders use models like this to assess the risk of their portfolios. For instance, if a trader has a portfolio consisting of various stocks, they can use this model to determine how much they might lose in adverse market conditions. By calculating VaR, traders can make informed decisions about how much capital to allocate to different investments, implement diversification strategies, and set stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses.

In summary, this example illustrates the practical application of risk assessment techniques in finance, reinforcing the concepts covered in Lecture 5 while providing you with hands-on coding experience that aligns with your goal of becoming a proficient Python Developer in stock trading.
