### Module Title: Introduction to Python Programming ###

### Exercise Requirements ###

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   Create a program that calculates the total investment amount after buying two different stocks. The user will input the price of each stock and the quantity purchased. The program will then sum these amounts to provide the total investment.

   **Scenario**: As a beginner Python Developer focusing on stock trading, understanding how to calculate total investments is crucial. This exercise will help you apply your knowledge of Python to real-world financial scenarios, reinforcing your learning from the lecture on the significance of Python in finance.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
   ```python
   # Starter code for calculating total investment in stocks
   def calculate_total_investment(stock1_price, stock1_quantity, stock2_price, stock2_quantity):
       # Calculate total investment by summing the investments in both stocks
       total_investment = (_______ * _______) + (_______ * _______)
       return total_investment

   # Example inputs for stocks
   stock1_price = float(input("Enter the price of Stock 1: "))  # e.g., 150.00
   stock1_quantity = int(input("Enter the quantity of Stock 1: "))  # e.g., 2
   stock2_price = float(input("Enter the price of Stock 2: "))  # e.g., 200.00
   stock2_quantity = int(input("Enter the quantity of Stock 2: "))  # e.g., 3

   # Test the function with user inputs
   print("Total Investment: $", calculate_total_investment(_____, _____, _____, _____))
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - Remember that to calculate the total investment for each stock, you need to multiply the price by the quantity purchased.
   - Ensure you are using the correct variable names as defined in the starter code.
   - Think about how you can enhance your program by adding error handling to manage invalid inputs (e.g., negative prices or quantities).

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   The student should successfully fill in the blanks with the appropriate variables and run the program to calculate the total investment. The final solution should include:
   - Correct multiplication of price and quantity for both stocks.
   - A well-structured output showing the total investment amount.
   - Comments explaining each part of the code, demonstrating an understanding of how to apply Python concepts to real-world financial scenarios.

### Integration ###
- Ensure the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.

### Additional Resources ###
- Consider reviewing tutorials on basic Python functions and error handling to enhance your understanding before attempting this exercise.
- Explore documentation on Pythonâ€™s input functions and data types to ensure you're comfortable with user input handling. 

By completing this exercise, you will not only reinforce your coding skills but also gain practical experience in financial calculations relevant to your career goals in stock trading.
