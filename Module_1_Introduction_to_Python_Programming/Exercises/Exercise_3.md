### Module Title: Introduction to Python Programming ###

### Exercise Requirements ###

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   In the context of stock trading, the Fibonacci sequence is often used in technical analysis to predict potential price movements. Your task is to create a Python program that generates and prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. This exercise will help you understand how loops work in Python and how you can apply this knowledge to analyze stock price trends using Fibonacci retracement levels.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**: 
   Below is the starter code for implementing the Fibonacci sequence using a loop. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality. Pay attention to the comments that guide you on how to use basic syntax and data types.

   ```python
   # Starter code for generating Fibonacci numbers
   def print_fibonacci(n):
       # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
       a = 0  # First number in the Fibonacci sequence
       b = 1  # Second number in the Fibonacci sequence
       
       # Print the first n Fibonacci numbers
       for i in range(n):
           print(a)  # Print the current Fibonacci number
           # Update the Fibonacci numbers
           next_number = _______ + _______  # Calculate the next number
           a = _______  # Update a to the next number
           b = _______  # Update b to the new next number

   # Call the function to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
   print_fibonacci(_____)
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - To calculate the next Fibonacci number, you need to add the two previous numbers together.
   - Remember that `a` and `b` hold the last two Fibonacci numbers, so use them appropriately in your calculation.
   - When updating `a` and `b`, ensure that `a` gets the value of `b`, and `b` gets the value of `next_number`.
   - The function should be called with `10` as an argument to print the first ten Fibonacci numbers.

4. **Expected Outcome**: 
   Upon filling in the blanks correctly, running your code should output the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:
   ```
   0
   1
   1
   2
   3
   5
   8
   13
   21
   34
   ```
   This exercise demonstrates your understanding of loops, variables, and basic arithmetic operations in Python, while also relating to stock trading concepts through the application of Fibonacci analysis.

### Integration ###
- Ensure that each section is clearly marked with headings for easy navigation.
- Use markdown formatting for clarity and include any necessary links to additional resources or references that may aid in understanding Fibonacci sequences in stock trading.
- This exercise can be integrated into your learning platform as part of your ongoing Python programming education, focusing on practical applications in finance.
