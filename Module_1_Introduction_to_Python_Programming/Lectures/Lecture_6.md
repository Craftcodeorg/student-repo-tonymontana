# Lecture 6: Introduction to Libraries: NumPy and pandas

## 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of NumPy and pandas libraries.
- Utilize NumPy for efficient numerical computations.
- Leverage pandas for data manipulation and analysis, particularly in financial contexts.
- Apply these libraries to real-world stock trading scenarios.

## 2. Introduction:
In this lecture, we will explore two powerful libraries in Python: **NumPy** and **pandas**. These libraries are essential tools for any Python Developer, especially those focusing on stock trading and finance. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. On the other hand, pandas is designed for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures like Series and DataFrames that make handling financial data straightforward.

Understanding these libraries is crucial for your career goal of becoming a Python Developer in stock trading, as they will help you manage and analyze vast amounts of financial data efficiently.

## 3. Core Concepts:
### 3.1 NumPy
- **What is NumPy?**: NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is a library that allows for efficient numerical computations and supports large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Key Features**:
  - **ndarray**: The core data structure in NumPy is the ndarray (N-dimensional array), which allows you to store and manipulate large datasets.
  - **Vectorization**: NumPy allows you to perform operations on entire arrays without writing loops, which speeds up calculations significantly.

### 3.2 pandas
- **What is pandas?**: pandas is a library built on top of NumPy that provides data structures and functions specifically designed for data analysis.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
  - **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.
  - **Data Manipulation**: pandas provides tools for reading/writing data, filtering, grouping, and aggregating data.

## 4. Practical Application:
### Example Scenario:
Imagine you are analyzing stock prices for NVIDIA (NVDA) to make informed trading decisions. You can use pandas to read historical stock price data from a CSV file and perform analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load stock price data
data = pd.read_csv('nvidia_stock_prices.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(data.head())

# Calculate the moving average of the closing prices
data['Moving Average'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()

# Display the updated DataFrame
print(data[['Date', 'Close', 'Moving Average']])
```

In this example, we load NVIDIA's stock price data into a pandas DataFrame, calculate a 5-day moving average of the closing prices, and display the results. This kind of analysis is fundamental in stock trading as it helps identify trends.

## 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we covered the basics of NumPy and pandas, two essential libraries for Python developers in finance. You learned about the ndarray structure in NumPy and the Series and DataFrame structures in pandas. Remember that these libraries will enable you to handle large datasets efficiently and perform complex data analyses, which are crucial skills in stock trading.

## 6. Next Steps:
In the next lecture, we will delve deeper into data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, which will help you represent your financial data graphically. To prepare for this, consider reviewing basic plotting concepts and think about how visual representations can aid in your stock trading decisions.
