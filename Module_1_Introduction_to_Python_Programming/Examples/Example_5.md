## Example 5: Importing and Using NumPy for Basic Calculations

### 1. Introduction
In this section, we will explore **Example 5: Importing and using NumPy for basic calculations**. This example builds upon the concepts discussed in Lecture 5, where we covered functions and modules in Python. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing that allows for efficient operations on large datasets, making it particularly useful in finance for tasks such as statistical analysis and mathematical computations.

Understanding how to import and utilize NumPy will enhance your ability to perform complex calculations with ease, thereby streamlining your coding process in stock trading applications. By leveraging this library, you can automate tasks such as calculating returns, averages, and other financial metrics quickly and efficiently.

### 2. Code Snippet
Here is a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to import NumPy and use it for basic financial calculations, such as calculating the average stock price and the standard deviation of stock returns:

```python
# Importing the NumPy library
import numpy as np

# Function to calculate average price and standard deviation of stock returns
def analyze_stock_prices(prices):
    try:
        # Convert the list of prices to a NumPy array
        price_array = np.array(prices)
        
        # Calculate average price
        average_price = np.mean(price_array)
        
        # Calculate standard deviation of prices
        std_deviation = np.std(price_array)
        
        # Return results as a dictionary
        return {
            'average_price': average_price,
            'std_deviation': std_deviation
        }
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
stock_prices = [100, 105, 102, 98, 110]
results = analyze_stock_prices(stock_prices)

# Print the results
print(f"Average Price: {results['average_price']:.2f}")
print(f"Standard Deviation: {results['std_deviation']:.2f}")
```

### 3. Explanation
Let's break down the code snippet step by step:

- **Importing NumPy**: The line `import numpy as np` imports the NumPy library and allows us to use its functions with the prefix `np`. This is a common convention in Python programming.

- **Defining the Function**: The function `analyze_stock_prices(prices)` takes a list of stock prices as input. This encapsulation allows us to reuse this function whenever we need to analyze stock prices.

- **Error Handling**: A try-except block is used to catch any potential errors that may arise during the execution of the code, ensuring that the program does not crash unexpectedly.

- **Converting to NumPy Array**: The line `price_array = np.array(prices)` converts the input list into a NumPy array, which allows us to leverage NumPy's optimized functions for calculations.

- **Calculating Average and Standard Deviation**: We use `np.mean(price_array)` to compute the average price and `np.std(price_array)` to calculate the standard deviation of the prices. These metrics are crucial in finance for assessing performance and risk.

- **Returning Results**: The function returns a dictionary containing both the average price and standard deviation, making it easy to access these values later.

- **Example Usage**: We create a list of stock prices and call our function to analyze them. Finally, we print out the results formatted to two decimal places.

### 4. Application
In the finance industry, analyzing stock prices is essential for making informed investment decisions. The ability to quickly calculate averages and standard deviations can help traders assess market trends and volatility. For instance, if a trader notices that the average price of a stock is rising while its standard deviation is low, it may indicate a stable upward trend, prompting them to consider investing.

By using NumPy for these calculations, traders can handle larger datasets efficiently, allowing for more complex analyses such as portfolio optimization or risk assessment. This not only saves time but also improves accuracy, which is vital in fast-paced trading environments.
